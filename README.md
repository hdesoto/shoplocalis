# FINAL PROJECT - SHOP LOCALIS

## Shoplocalis is an online marketplace for local shops.

This is a project developed as a final project for the **Skylab Coders Academy** ***full-stack web developement*** bootcamp.

The main objective is to put into practice all the tools, skills and technologies learned during the course.

##SHOP LOCALIS

ShopLocalis is an online marketplace where small shops can show all their products to a wider audience. The buyers profile is someone who prefer to buy into local/small shops in their neighbourhood or town, but due to lack of time (due to working in another town or without free time during the week) usually end up buying in big stores and shopping centers.

We aim at helping the small shops, not having a technical background nor the investment (in time and capital) necessary to create and maintain their own online stores.

Our objective is to offer two types of buying experiences: pick-up or delivery. The delivery could be handled by "our company".

All the payment processing will also be handled by our website.
